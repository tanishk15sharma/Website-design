Best way to achive perfection in CSS is to practice it out !
I have made a website in which I learnt so many new things and practiced each of them . this website is RESPONSIVE in nature .Btw colouring is not that much good of UI as the main purpose is to practice CSS ,
FLEX-BOX and GRID. 

You must have a look at the Website :)
